# Gesturly 
A Gesture-Driven Desktop Interface in Python

Gesturly is a Python-based project that explores **hand gesture recognition combined with a custom graphical user interface (GUI)**. The goal of the project is to create a smooth, interactive system where gestures can be detected, processed, and reflected visually in real time.

This project focuses on **separating gesture logic from UI logic**, making the system modular, readable, and easy to extend for future features such as gesture-controlled actions, accessibility tools, or creative interfaces.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Learn and experiment with **gesture recognition pipelines**
- Build a **custom desktop GUI** that reacts to gesture input
- Keep the architecture **modular and scalable**
- Create a clean base for future gesture-controlled applications

## 🧠 High-Level Overview

Gesturly is split into two main parts:

1. **Gesture Processing Layer**  
   Handles gesture detection, interpretation, and state management.

2. **User Interface Layer**  
   Displays information, animations, or responses based on detected gestures.

This separation ensures that:
- Gesture logic can evolve without rewriting the UI
- The UI can be redesigned without touching gesture detection
- The project remains easy to debug and extend
